Matterbridge dynamic platform example plugin is a template to develop your own plugin using the dynamic platform.

It exposes:

- a switch with onOff cluster
- a light with onOff
- a light with onOff and levelControl (dimmer)
- a light with onOff, levelControl and colorControl (with XY, HS and CT) clusters
- a light with onOff, levelControl and colorControl (with HS only) clusters
- a light with onOff, levelControl and colorControl (with XY only) clusters
- a light with onOff, levelControl and colorControl (with CT only) clusters
- an outlet (plug) with onOff cluster
- a cover with windowCovering cluster
- a lock with doorLock cluster
- a thermo with thermostat cluster and 3 sub endpoints with flowMeasurement cluster, temperatureMeasurement cluster
  and relativeHumidityMeasurement cluster (to show how to create a composed device with sub endpoints)
- a fan with FanControl cluster
- a rainSensor device
- a waterFreezeDetector device
- a waterLeakDetector device
- a smokeCoAlarm device

All these devices continuously change state and position. The plugin also shows how to use all the command handlers (you can control all the devices) and how to subscribe to attributes.

If you like this project and find it useful, please consider giving it a star on GitHub at https://github.com/Luligu/matterbridge-example-dynamic-platform and sponsoring it.
